        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hi, my name is Daniel, and I'm a student of finance and economics with a passion for digital technologies. I'm currently pursuing my master's degree while working with a research group that explores the intersection of digital finance technologies and digital identities. I'm fascinated by the potential of technology to transform the way we live, work, and interact with one another.
<br> <br>
When I'm not working or studying, I love to spend time with nature. I've always had a deep interest in botany and plants, and I love exploring different ecosystems and habitats across Europe. I'm also an avid sailor, and I find peace and tranquility near the sea. I enjoy building small Arduino and coding projects in my spare time, and I find it incredibly satisfying to see my ideas come to life. I also enjoy playing cards and brewing and fermenting different foods and beverages. There's something incredibly rewarding about creating something from scratch.
<br> <br>
I grew up in Canada and have lived in different parts of Europe, which has given me a unique perspective on the world. I love learning about different cultures and ways of life, and I find it incredibly enriching to connect with people from all walks of life.
<br> <br>
Overall, I'm excited about what the future holds and am eager to contribute to the world in a meaningful way. My diverse skillset and passion for technology put me in an excellent position to make a positive impact on the field of finance and beyond.</p>
